# Grid Coloring

When a problem I'm working on involves a square grid, I draw some straight (citation needed) lines on a piece of paper with a pen and then do my work on it with a pencil. The primary benefit of replicating this process digitally is the ability to easily save and share final or intermediate images. It also looks prettier.
